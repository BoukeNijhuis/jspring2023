Introduction story

Hello everybody. Welcome. Very nice of you to join this session.

I would like to start with a story today. Once upon a time there was a developer. He had about 10/15 years of experience.
He was happily coding away, until he noticed something. He noticed that the debugger had become an important tool in his
toolbox. This while he was only scratching the proverbial tip of the iceberg. So he decided to become better at using the
debugger. To explore the part of the iceberg under the surface. He read a lot of articles and blogs, watched YouTube
videos and just started playing in het IDE with all the options of the debugger. He learned a lot in his journey and
decided to create a presentation. This presentation.

My name is Bouke Nijhuis, I am the CTO at CINQ ICT and you can easily reach me on Twitter on the handle currently on the
screen. The topic of today is improving your skills with debugger.
